Heaps are binary tree based data structure 

Heaps - 1]MinHeap = Root>rest of ele present in its subtree
        2]MaxHeap = Root<rest of ele present in its subtree

Using Heapify operations we make minheap and MaxHeap

Heap STL
MaxHeap  = priority_queue<int,vector<int>>
MinHeap = priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>>

push = O(logn)
pop = O(logn)
top = O(1)
size = O(1)
